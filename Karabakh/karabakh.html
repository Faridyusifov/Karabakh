      <h2>Etymology</h2>
   </div>
   <div class="text">
      <p>
         The <a href="#">Russian</a> name Карабах, <a href="#">transliterated</a> <i>Karabakh</i>,
         derives from the <a href="#">Azerbaijani</a> <i>Qarabağ</i>, which is generally believed 
         to be a compound of the <a href="#">Turkic</a> <i>word kara </i>(black) and the <a href="#">Iranian</a> word <i>bagh</i> (garden),
         literally meaning "black garden."<sup><a href="#">[6]</a></sup> However, there are some other hypotheses.
      </p>
      <p>
         Russian Orientalist <a href="#">Vladimir Minorsky</a> believed that the name possibly connected
         to the same-titled extinct Turkic tribe. By comparison, there are similar toponyms
         in Azerbaijan, Iran, Turkey and Afghanistan.<sup><a href="#">[7]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Iranian <a href="#">linguist</a> Abdolali Karang, <i>kara</i> could have derived from 
        <i>kaleh</i> or <i>kala</i>, which means "large" in the <a href="#">Harzani</a> dialect of the extinct Iranian
        <a href="#">Old Azeri language</a>.<sup><a href="#">[8][9][10]</a></sup> The <a href="#">Iranian-Azerbaijani</a> historian <a>Ahmad Kasravi</a> also
        speaks of the translation of <i>kara</i> as "large" and not "black."<sup><a href="#">[11]</a></sup> The <i>kara</i> prefix has
        also been used for other nearby regions and landmarks, such as <a href="#">Karadagh</a> (<i>dagh</i> "mountain")
        referring to a mountain range, and <i>Karakilise</i> (<i>kilise</i> "church") referring to the largest
        church complex in its area, built mainly with white stone, the <a href="#">Monastery of Saint Thaddeus</a>. 
        In the sense of "large," <i>Karakilise</i> would translate to "large church," and <i>Karabakh</i> 
        would translate to "large garden."
      </p>
      <p>
        The placename is first mentioned in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries
        in <a href="#">The Georgian Chronicles</a> (<a href="#">Georgian</a>: ქართლის ცხოვრება "Life of Kartli"), 
        and in Persian sources.<sup><a href="#">[12]</a></sup> The name became common after the 1230s when the 
        region was conquered by the <a href="#">Mongols</a>.<sup><a href="#">[13]</a></sup> The first time the name was mentioned 
        in medieval Armenian sources was in the fifteenth century, 
        in <a href="#">Thomas of Metsoph</a>'s <i>History of Tamerlane and His Successors</i>.<sup><a href="#">[12]</a></sup>

        <h2>Geography</h2>
     </div>
     <div class="text2">
    <p>Karabakh is a landlocked region located in the south of <a href="#">Armenia</a> and the west of <a>Azerbaijan</a>. 
       There is currently no official designation for what constitutes the whole of Karabakh. 
       Historically, the maximum extent of what could be considered Karabakh was during the 
       existence of the <a href="#">Karabakh Khanate</a> in the 18th century, which extended from the <a href="#">Zangezur Mountains</a> 
       in the west, following eastwards along the <a href="#">Aras river</a> to the point where it meets with the <a href="#">Kura river</a> 
       in the <a href="#">Kur-Araz Lowland</a>. Following the Kura river north, it stretched as far as what is today 
       the <a href="#">Mingachevir reservoir</a> before turning back to the Zangezur Mountains through the <a href="#">Murov Mountains</a>. 
       However, when not referring to the territory covered by the Karabakh Khanate, 
       the northern regions are often excluded (modern-day <a href="#">Goranboy</a> and <a href="#">Yevlakh</a>). 
       During the <a href="#">Russian Empire</a>, the eastern lowlands where the Kura and Aras rivers meet 
       (mostly modern-day <a href="#">Imishli</a>) were also excluded, but most pre-<a href="#">Elisabethpol</a> maps include that 
       region in Karabakh.

         <p>
          The region today referred to as Karabakh, which was 
          populated with various <a href="#">Caucasian</a> tribes, is believed 
          to have been conquered by the <a href="#">Kingdom of Armenia</a> in 
          the 2<sup>nd</sup> century BC and organized as parts of the <a href="#">Artsakh</a>, 
          <a href="#">Utik</a> and the southern regions of <a href="#">Syunik</a> provinces. 
          However, it is possible that the region had earlier been 
          part of the <a href="#">Satrapy of Armenia</a> under the <a href="#">Orontid</a> dynasty 
          from as early as the 4<sup>th</sup> century BC.<a><sup>[14]</sup></a> After the partition 
          of Armenia by <a href="#">Rome</a> and <a href="#">Persia</a> in 387 AD, Artsakh and Utik 
          became a part of the <a href="#">Caucasian Albanian satrapy</a> of <a href="#">Sassanian Persia</a>, 
          while Syunik remained in Armenia.
         </p>
         <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 13px;">Middle Ages</h3>
         <p>
            The <a href="#">Arab invasions</a> later led to the rise of several Armenian princes who came to establish their 
            dominance in the region.<a href="#"><sup>[15]</sup></a> Centuries of constant warfare on the Armenian Plateau forced many 
            Armenians, including those in the Karabakh region, to emigrate and settle elsewhere. During the 
            period of Mongol domination, a great number of Armenians left Lowland Karabakh and sought refuge 
            in the mountainous (Highland) heights of the region.<a href="#"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>
            From the 11th century and onwards Karabakh became a home to numerous <a href="#">Oghuz Turkic tribes</a>, 
            the ancestors of the modern <a href="#">Azeris</a>, who sticked to the nomadic way of life, circulating between 
            the winter pastures in Karabakh lowlands and the summer pastures in Karabakh highlands.<a href="#"><sup>[17][18]</sup></a> 
            These tribes dominated the region<a href="#"><sup>[17]</sup></a>, and were key allies of the Safavid Empire, that owned Karabakh 
            in 16th-early 18th centuries.<a href="#"><sup>[19]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>
            In the fifteenth century, the <a href="#">German</a> traveler <a href="#">Johann Schiltberger</a> toured Lowland Karabakh and described 
            it as a large and beautiful plain in Armenia, ruled by Muslims.<a href="#"><sup>[20]</sup></a> Highland Karabakh from 821 until 
            the early 19th century passed under the hands of a number of states, including the <a href="#">Abbasid Caliphate</a>, 
            <a href="#">Bagratid Armenia</a>, the Mongol <a href="#">Ilkhanate</a> and <a href="#">Jalayirid Sultanates</a>, the Turkic <a href="#">Kara Koyunlu</a>,<a href="#">Ak Koyunlu</a> 
            and Karabakh Baylarbaylik states of the <a href="#">Safavid Empire</a>.<a href="#"><sup>[21]</sup></a> Armenian princes times ruled as vassal 
            territories by the Armenian House of <a href="#">Khachen</a> and its several lines, the latter <a href="#">Melikdoms of Karabakh</a>.<a href="#"><sup>[25]</sup></a> 
            The Safavids appointed the rulers of <a href="#">Ganja khanate</a> from Ziad-oglu Qajar family to govern Karabakh.<a href="#"><sup>[22]</sup></a> 
            It was also invaded and ruled by <a href="#">Ottoman Empire</a> between 1578-1605 and again between 1723-1736, as they 
            briefly conquered it during the <a href="#">Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578-1590</a> and during the disintegration of Safavid Iran, 
            respectively. In 1747, <a href="#">Panah Ali Khan</a>, a local <a href="#">Turkic</a> chieftain from the <a href="#">Javanshir clan</a>, seized control of the 
            region after the death of the Persian ruler <a href="#">Nader Shah</a>,and both Lower Karabakh and Highland Karabakh comprised the new

         <p>
            In 1813, under the terms of the <a href="#">Treaty of Gulistan</a>, the region of Karabakh was lost by the <a href="#">Persians</a> to the <a href="#">Russian Empire</a>. Under Russian rule, 
            Karabakh (both Lowland and Highland) was a region with an area of 13,600 km2 (5,250 sq mi), with <a href="#">Shusha</a> (Shushi) as its most prominent city. 
            Its population consisted of <a href="#">Armenians</a> and <a href="#">Muslims</a> (mainly of <a href="#">Azerbaijanis</a>, then known as Tatars, but also <a href="#">Kurds</a>). The Russians conducted a 
            census in 1823 and had tallied the number of villages (though not the number of people) and asse  the tax basis of the entire Karabakh khanate, 
            which also included Lowland Karabakh.<a href="#"><sup>[23]</sup></a> It is probable that the Armenians formed the majority of the population of Eastern Armenia at the turn of 
            the seventeenth century,<a href="#"><sup>[24]</sup></a><sup>[<a href="#">disputed</a> - <a href="#">discuss</a>][<a href="#">verify</a>]</sup> but following Shah Abbas I's massive relocation of Armenians in 1604-05 their numbers 
            decreased markedly, as they eventually became a minority among their Muslim neighbors.
         </p>
         <p>
            According to the statistics of the initial survey carried out by the Russians in 1823 and an official one published in 1836, Highland Karabakh was 
            found almost overwhelmingly Armenian in population (96.7%).<a href="#"><sup>[25]</sup></a> In contrast, the population of the Karabakh khanate, taken as a whole, was largely             
            made up of Muslims (91% Muslim versus 9% Armenian).<a href="#"><sup>[26]</sup></a> A decade after the Russian annexation of the region, many Armenians who had fled Karabakh 
            during the reign of <a href="#">Ibrahim Khalil Khan</a> (1730-1806) and settled in Yerevan, <a href="#">Ganja</a>, and parts of <a href="#">Georgia</a> were repatriated to their villages, many 
            of which had been left derelict.<a href="#"><sup>[25]</sup></a> An additional 279 Armenian families were settled in the villages of <a href="#">Ghapan</a> and <a href="#">Meghri</a> in Syunik.<a href="#"><sup>[25]</sup></a> Though 
            some of the returning Armenians wished to settle in Karabakh, they were told by Russian authorities that there was no room for them.<a href="#"><sup>[25]</sup></a> This took 
            place at the same time as many of the region's Muslims departed for the <a href="#">Ottoman Empire</a> and <a href="#">Qajar Iran</a>.<a href="#"><sup>[27]</sup></a> The population of Karabakh, according 
            to the official returns of 1832, consisted of 13,965 Muslim and 1,491 Armenian families, besides some <a ng-readonly="#">Nestorian Christians</a> and <a href="#">Gypsies</a>. The limited 
            population was ascribed to the frequent wars and emigration of many Muslim families to Iran since the region's subjection to Russia, although many 
            Armenians were induced by the Russian government, after the <a href="#">Treaty of Turkmenchay</a>, to emigrate from Persia to Karabakh.<a href="#"><sup>[27]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>
            It has to be noted that censuses and surveys, which were conducted in winter, did not count tens of thousands Azeri nomads, who stayed in the 
            lowlands during winter and were migrating en masse to the summer pastures in Mountainous Karabakh during the warmer months. Seasonal demographic 
            changes were significant, as e.g. in 1845 in historic Karabakh the population included 30,000 Armenians and 62,000 Moslems (Azeris), of whom 
            approximately 50,000 were nomads, who circulated between Lowland and Mountainous Karabakh.<a href="#"><sup>[29]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>
            In 1828 the Karabakh khanate was dissolved and in 1840 it was absorbed into the Kaspijskaya oblast, and subsequently, in 1846, made a part of 
            <a href="#">Shemakha Governorate</a>. In 1876 it was made a part of the <a href="#">Elisabethpol Governorate</a>, an administrative arrangement which remained in place until 
            the Russian Empire collapsed in 1917.

         <p>
            After the dissolution of Russian Empire Karabakh, Zangezur and Nakhchivan were disputed between newly established republics of 
            Armenia and <a href="#">Azerbaijan</a>.<a href="#"><sup>[30]</sup></a> Fighting between two republics broke out. Following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in <a href="#">World War I</a>/, 
            British troops occupied the <a href="#">South Caucasus</a>. The British command affirmed Khosrov bey Sultanov (an appointee of the Azerbaijani government) 
            as the provisional governor-general of Karabakh and Zangezur, pending a final decision by the <a href="#">Paris Peace Conference</a>. 
            Local Armenian Council confronted this till the August of 1919, when it was subjected by Azeri military to admit the provisional 
            jurisdiction of Azerbaijan. However, later Karabakh Armenians accused Azerbaijan in the violation of the treaty of 1919 and pursuit 
            for the further submission of them to Azerbaijan and rebelled in the March of 1920 with the help of emissaries from Armenia. 
            Uprising failed, as Azerbaijani forced quickly restored control over the main centers of Karabakh (Shusha, Khankendi, Askeran), 
            although fighting in the countryside of Mountainous Karabakh continued. In April 1920, Azerbaijan and Armenia were sovietized and 
            Karabakh's status was taken up by the Soviet authorities. In 1921 after the heavy trilateral negotiations Soviets decided that 
            Karabakh has to remain within Azerbaijan.<a href="#"><sup>[31]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>
            In 1923, Armenian parts of Mountainous Karabakh were made a part of the newly established <a href="#">Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast</a> (NKAO), 
            an administrative entity of the <a href="#">Azerbaijan SSR</a>. According to the first census of this administrative unit the population was 94% Armenian<a href="#"><sup>[32]</sup></a>, 
            however, this census did not count a considerable Azeri nomadic population.<a href="#"><sup>[33]</sup></a> Besides, it has to be mentioned that NKAO is Armenian-dominated 
            part of historical Mountainous Karabakh<a href="#"><sup>[34]</sup></a> and many Azeri villages of this region were administratively excluded from the former<a href="#"><sup>[35]</sup></a>.
         </p>
         <p>
            During the Soviet period, several few attempts were made by the authorities of 
            the <a>Armenian SSR</a> to unite it with the NKAO but these proposals found no support in Moscow.

         <strong>Nagorno-Karabakh War</strong>
         <p style="padding-left: 20px;">Main article: <a href="#"><i>First Nagorno-Karabakh War</i></a></p>
         <p>
            In February 1988, within the context of <a href="#">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>'s <i>glasnost</i> and <i>perestroika</i> policies, 
            the Supreme Soviet of the NKAO voted to unite itself with Armenia.<a href="#"><sup>[36]</sup></a> By the summer of 1989 
            the Armenian-populated areas of the NKAO were under blockade by Azerbaijan as a response to 
            Armenia's blockade against <a href="#">Nakhichevan</a>, cutting road and rail links to the outside world. 
            On July 12 the Nagorno-Karabakh AO Supreme Soviet voted to secede from Azerbaijan, 
            which was rejected unanimously by the <a href="#">Supreme Soviet of USSR</a>, declaring NKAO had no 
            right to secede from <a href="#">Azerbaijan SSR</a> under Soviet Constitution.<a href="#"><sup>[37]</sup></a> Soviet authorities in 
            Moscow then placed the region under its direct rule, installing a special commission to 
            govern the region. In November 1989 the Kremlin returned the oblast to Azerbaijani control. 
            The local government in the region of <a href="#">Shahumian</a> also declared its independence from the 
            Azerbaijan SSR in 1991.<a href="#"><sup>[38]</sup></a>
         </p>
         <p>
            In late 1991, the Armenian representatives in the local government of the NKAO proclaimed the region a republic, 
            independent from Azerbaijan. Portions of the lowland Karabakh are now under the control of the Karabakh Armenian forces. 
            The region's Azerbaijani inhabitants were forced to leave the territories remaining under Armenian control.
         </p>

         <p>
            While Nagorno-Karabakh remains an internationally recognised territory of Azerbaijan, as of October 2020, 
            four UN security council resolutions, adopted in 1993 and demanding immediate withdrawal of the Armenian 
            occupying forces from all occupied regions of Azerbaijan, remain unfulfilled.<a href="#"><sup>[39]</sup></a>

            The Armenian population of the region speaks the Karabakh dialect of Armenian which has been heavily 
            influenced by the Persian, Russian, and Turkish languages.<a href="#"><sup>[40]</sup></a> It was the most extensively spoken of 
            all Armenian dialects until the Soviet period when the dialect of <a href="#">Yerevan</a> became the official tongue of
